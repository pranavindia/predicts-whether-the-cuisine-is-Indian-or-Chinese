# predicts-whether-the-cuisine-is-Indian-or-Chinese
In this problem scenario, we are constructing a machine learning pipeline on the MLEnd Yummy dataset, which takes as input a photo of a dish. Subsequently, it filters the dataset to include items with cuisine related to either Indian or Chinese cuisine, and consequently, predicts whether the cuisine is Indian or Chinese.

The MLEnd Yummy Dataset comprises 3250 rows and 12 columns, including:

Photos of dishes

Dish names

Home or restaurant designation

Cuisine

Ingredients

Diet information

Healthiness rating

Tastiness rating

The presence of 'Benchmark_A' facilitates the division of our entire dataset into training and testing sets.

The objective is to employ machine learning algorithms to provide highly accurate predictions regarding whether the image corresponds to a Indian or Chinese cuisine.
